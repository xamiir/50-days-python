# 50 Days of Python Code

Welcome to the 50 Days of Python Code repository! This project is aimed at helping Python learners to improve their skills by engaging in daily coding exercises for 50 days.

## Overview

The 50 Days of Python Code project provides a structured learning path for Python enthusiasts to enhance their programming proficiency. Each day, participants are encouraged to complete a coding challenge or exercise related to Python programming. The challenges are designed to cover a wide range of topics, including basic syntax, data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with the 50 Days of Python Code challenge, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/xamiir/50-days-python-code.git`.

2. Navigate to the cloned directory: `cd 50-days-python-code`.

3. Begin with Day 1 by opening the corresponding folder (`day-01`) and accessing the Python file or Jupyter Notebook containing the challenge instructions.

4. Complete the challenge for the day by writing Python code that meets the requirements specified in the instructions.

5. Once you've completed the challenge, you can optionally share your solution by submitting a pull request to the main repository.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each corresponding to a day of the challenge. Inside each folder, you'll find the following files:

- `README.md`: Contains instructions and details about the coding challenge for the day.
- `solution.py` (or `solution.ipynb`): Placeholder file where you can write your Python code to solve the challenge.
- Any additional resources or files necessary for completing the challenge.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to the 50 Days of Python Code project are welcome! If you have suggestions for new challenges, improvements to existing challenges, or any other enhancements, feel free to submit a pull request.

To contribute, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.

2. Create a new branch from the `main` branch for your changes.

3. Make your desired changes and additions.

4. Test your changes to ensure they work as expected.

5. Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages.

6. Push your changes to your forked repository.

7. Submit a pull request to the main repository, detailing the changes you've made and why they should be incorporated.
