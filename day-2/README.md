## Python Quickstart
Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.

The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:

`  C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py  `
* Where "helloworld.py" is the name of your python file.

* Let's write our first Python file, called helloworld.py, which can be done in any text editor.
