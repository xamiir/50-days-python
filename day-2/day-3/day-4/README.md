# Python - Variable Names

Variable Names
* A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
* A variable name cannot start with a number
* A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
* Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

## Example 

myvar = "John"

my_var = "John"

_my_var = "John"

myVar = "John"

MYVAR = "John"

myvar2 = "John"


# Python Variables - Assign Multiple Values
Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:

* Example 

x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"

print(x)

print(y)

print(z)

 # Camel Case
Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:

 * myVariableName = "John"

# Pascal Case
Each word starts with a capital letter:

* MyVariableName = "John"
# Snake Case
Each word is separated by an underscore character:

* my_variable_name = "John"
