# Python Comments
* Comments can be used to explain Python code.

* Comments can be used to make the code more readable.

* Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.


### they are two types comments in python 
## 1 single
 ` #This is a comment `
## 2 Multi Line Comments
 * Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.

* To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:
* Example

`  #This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line `

# Python Variables
 Variables are containers for storing data values.

 ## Creating Variables
* Python has no command for declaring a variable.

* A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.


* Example 

`  x = 5  ` 

` y = "John"`

 ` print(x)` 

 `print(y)   `

 # Case-Sensitive
* Variable names are case-sensitive.

Example
This will create two variables:

a = 4

A = "Sally"

#A will not overwrite a
