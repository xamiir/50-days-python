# Python Casting

## Specify a Variable Type

There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.

Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:

- int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)
- float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)
- str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals

# Python Booleans

- Booleans represent one of two values: True or False.

## Boolean Values

In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False.

You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False.

When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer:
