# Python Lists

- List
  Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

Lists are created using square brackets:

## Example

- Create a List:

`thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] print(thislist)`

## List Items

List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

## Ordered

When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.

- Note: There are some list methods that will change the order, but in general: the order of the items will not change.

- Changeable
  The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

## Python Collections (Arrays)

There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

- List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
- Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
- Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable\*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
- Dictionary is a collection which is ordered\*\* and changeable. No duplicate members.
